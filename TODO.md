- Write a splice/sendfile helper to read from and write to pipes.

- Make a general review of file handling, specially use more O_TMPFILE, check that everything is O_SYNC, etc.
- Snapshots seems to not be performing the `rename` correctly.
- Maybe use timed locks to report timeouts while waiting on a different process.
